# Stegnography
# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

## Overview
This project is a simple steganography application built using Python and Tkinter that allows users to hide secret messages inside images and later retrieve them. The project utilizes the `stegano` library for data hiding and `PIL` for image processing.

## Features
- Load an image for steganography.
- Hide a secret text message within the image.
- Reveal the hidden message from the image.
- Save the modified image containing the hidden message.
- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Pillow)
- **Steganography Library**: Stegano (LSB)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install stegano pillow
```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python steganography.py
   ```
2. Click "Open Image" to select an image (PNG or JPG).
3. Enter a secret message in the text box.
4. Click "Hide Data" to embed the message in the image.
5. Click "Save Image" to save the modified image.
6. Click "Show Data" to retrieve the hidden message from the selected image.

## End Users
- Cybersecurity Enthusiasts
- Data Privacy Advocates
- Individuals who need secure communication
- Students and Researchers interested in steganography

## Wow Factors
- Simple and interactive GUI for ease of use.
- Uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique.
- Allows both encoding and decoding within the same interface.
- No noticeable changes in image quality after hiding data.

## Future Scope
- Support for more image formats (e.g., BMP, GIF).
- Encryption of hidden messages for enhanced security.
- Implement batch processing to hide messages in multiple images at once.
- Develop a web-based version using Flask/Django.
